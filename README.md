## Introduction
The Phantom Engine is a game engine aimed at making retro aesthetic games. Currently it's being developed along side [Fear The Crow](https://github.com/ionthedev/Fear-the-Crow), a quake styled shooter game.
Currently it does not have a GUI and won't have one for a long time. So in it's current state, it is a code only project.

## Libraries
Currently we are only using the following
- [Raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib?tab=Zlib-1-ov-file#readme)
- [Imgui-Docking](https://github.com/ZephyrWolf/imgui-docking)
- [rlImGui](https://github.com/raylib-extras/rlImGui)

## How to Install
The setup for the engine is the same as Raylib's setup.

- Windows: https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/wiki/Working-on-Windows
- Linux: https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/wiki/Working-on-GNU-Linux
- MacOS: https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/wiki/Working-on-macOS
